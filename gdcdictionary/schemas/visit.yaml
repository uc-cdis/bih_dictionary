description: This table contains events where subjects engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time. They are often also called “encounters”. Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed.

## MIDRC Visit Props
  days_to_hospital_admission:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the date of the patient's hospital admission.
    type: integer
  days_to_hospital_discharge:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the date of the patient's hospital discharge.
    type: integer
  days_to_icu_admission:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the date of the patient's ICU admission.
    type: integer
  days_to_icu_discharge:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the date of the patient's ICU discharge..
    type: integer    
  discharge_type:
    description: The status or destination of the patient at the time of discharge.
    type: string      

## OMOP props
  admitted_from_concept_id:
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was admitted from. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was admitted to the hospital from a long-term care facility, for example. If available, map the admitted_from_source_value to a standard concept in the visit domain. If a person was admitted from home or was self-referred, set this to 0.
    type: string

  admitted_from_source_value:
    description: This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating where a person was admitted from. Typically this applies only to visits that have a length of stay, like inpatient visits or long-term care visits.
    type: string

  days_to_visit_end:
    description: The difference in days between the subject's index_date and the end of the visit.
    type: string

  days_to_visit_start:
    description: The difference in days between the subject's index_date and the start of the visit.
    type: string

  discharged_to_concept_id:
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was discharged to after a visit. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was transferred to another hospital or sent to a long-term care facility, for example. It is assumed that a person is discharged to home therefore there is not a standard concept id for “home”. Use concept id = 0 when a person is discharged to home.	If available, map the discharged_to_source_value to a standard concept in the visit domain. 
    type: string

  discharged_to_source_value:
    description: This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating where a person was discharged to after a visit, as in they went home or were moved to long-term care. Typically this applies only to visits that have a length of stay of a day or more.
    type: string

  preceding_visit_occurrence_id:
    description: Use this field to find the visit that occurred for the person prior to the given visit. There could be a few days or a few years in between.	This field can be used to link a visit immediately preceding the current visit. Note this is not symmetrical, and there is no such thing as a “following_visit_id”.
    type: string

  provider_id:
    description: There will only be one provider per visit record and the ETL document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). If there are multiple providers associated with a visit in the source, this can be reflected in the event tables (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, etc.) or in the VISIT_DETAIL table.	If there are multiple providers associated with a visit, you will need to choose which one to put here. The additional providers can be stored in the VISIT_DETAIL table.
    type: string

  site_id:
    description: The care site ID. 
    type: string

  visit_concept_id:
    description: This field contains a concept id representing the kind of visit, like inpatient or outpatient. All concepts in this field should be standard and belong to the Visit domain.	Populate this field based on the kind of visit that took place for the person. For example this could be “Inpatient Visit”, “Outpatient Visit”, “Ambulatory Visit”, etc. This table will contain standard concepts in the Visit domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. 
    type: string

  visit_source_concept_id:
    description: If the visit source value is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here.
    type: string

  visit_source_value:
    description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the kind of visit that took place (inpatient, outpatient, emergency, etc.)	If there is information about the kind of visit in the source data that value should be stored here. If a visit is an amalgamation of visits from the source then use a hierarchy to choose the visit source value, such as IP -> ER-> OP. This should line up with the logic chosen to determine how visits are created.
    type: string

  visit_type_concept_id:
    description: Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit record, or where the record comes from.	Populate this field based on the provenance of the visit record, as in whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim.  A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the vocabulary wiki.
    type: string

  subjects:
    description: The submitter_id or id of the subject this visit belongs to, i.e., a link to a record in the parent node.
