  age_at_imaging:
    description: The study participant's age, in years, at the time the imaging study was performed. Note that an age of 0 indicates a participant who is younger than 1 year old. For participants with ages greater than 89 years, please use the property 'age_at_index_gt89'.
    type: number
    maximum: 89
    minimum: 0

  age_at_imaging_gt89:
    description: Indicates whether the age of the patient in years at the time the imaging study was performed is greater than 89 years.
    enum:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"

  body_part_examined:
    description: (0018, 0015) Body Part Examined.

      type: string

  days_from_study_to_neg_covid_test:
    description: The number of days from the imaging study to the patient's negative COVID-19 test(s).  This property takes a list of values, each of which represents a COVID-19 test for the patient. A positive value for this property means that a negative COVID-19 test result was obtained for the patient that many days after the imaging study was performed. A negative value indicates that a negative COVID-19 test result was obtained prior to the date of imaging.
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer

  days_from_study_to_pos_covid_test:
    description: The number of days from the imaging study to the patient's positive COVID-19 test(s).  This property takes a list of values, each of which represents a COVID-19 test for the patient. A positive value for this property means that a positive COVID-19 test result was obtained for the patient that many days after the imaging study was performed. A negative value indicates that the positive COVID-19 test result was obtained prior to the date of imaging.
