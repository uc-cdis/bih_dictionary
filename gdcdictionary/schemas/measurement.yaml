description: Records of Measurements, i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through systematic and standardized examination or testing of a subject's sample. The measurement table contains both orders and results of measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result.
