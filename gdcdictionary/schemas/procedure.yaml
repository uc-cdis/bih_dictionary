  breathing_support_type: # from MIDRC
    description: The type of breathing support the patient received.
    type: string

  days_to_procedure_start:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the start date of the procedure.
    type: integer  

  days_to_procedure_end:
    description: The number of days between the subject's index date and the end date of the procedure.
    type: integer  

  modifier_concept_id:
    description: The modifiers are intended to give additional information about the procedure but as of now the vocabulary is under review. It is up to the ETL to choose how to map modifiers if they exist in source data. These concepts are typically distinguished by 'Modifier' concept classes (e.g., 'CPT4 Modifier' as part of the 'CPT4' vocabulary). If there is more than one modifier on a record, one should be chosen that pertains to the procedure rather than provider. Accepted Concepts.
    type: string

  modifier_source_value:
    description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the modifier code for the procedure that occurred. The value stored here is mapped to a MODIFIER_CONCEPT_ID.
    type: string

  procedure_concept_id:
    description: The PROCEDURE_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source value which represents a procedure The CONCEPT_ID that the PROCEDURE_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. Only records whose source values map to standard concepts with a domain of “Procedure” should go in this table. Accepted Concepts.
    type: string

  procedure_name:
    description: The textual categorization of the procedure performed.
    type: string

  procedure_occurrence_id:
    description: The unique key given to a procedure record for a person. Refer to the ETL for how duplicate procedures during the same visit were handled. Each instance of a procedure occurrence in the source data should be assigned this unique key. In some subjects, a person can have multiple records of the same procedure within the same visit. It is valid to keep these duplicates and assign them individual, unique, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE_IDs, though it is up to the ETL how they should be handled.
    type: string

  procedure_source_concept_id:
    description: This is the concept representing the procedure source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Procedure necessary for a given analytic use subject. Consider using PROCEDURE_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. If the PROCEDURE_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here.
    type: string

  procedure_source_value:
    description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the procedure that occurred. For example, this could be an CPT4 or OPCS4 code. Use this value to look up the source concept id and then map the source concept id to a standard concept id.
    type: string

  procedure_type_concept_id:
    description: This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Procedure record, as in whether the procedure was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources. Choose the PROCEDURE_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID that best represents the provenance of the record, for example whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim. If a procedure is recorded as an EHR encounter, the PROCEDURE_TYPE_CONCEPT would be 'EHR encounter record'. Accepted Concepts. A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the vocabulary wiki.
    type: string

  provider_id:
    description: The provider associated with the procedure record, e.g. the provider who performed the Procedure. The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record, for example the admitting vs attending physician on an EHR record.
    type: string

  quantity:
    description: If the quantity value is omitted, a single procedure is assumed. If a Procedure has a quantity of '0' in the source, this should default to '1' in the ETL. If there is a record in the source it can be assumed the exposure occurred at least once.
    type: string

  site_id:
    description: The care site ID. 
    type: string

  visit_id:
    description: A foreign key to the visit in the VISIT table during which the device was used.
    type: string

  conditions:
    description: The submitter_id or id of the condition to which this procedure is related, i.e., a link to a record in the parent node.
    $ref: "_definitions.yaml#/to_one"

  subjects:
    description: The submitter_id or id of the subject to which this procedure is related, i.e., a link to a record in the parent node.
    $ref: "_definitions.yaml#/to_one"
