description: The drug exposure domain captures records about the utilization of a Drug when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will exert a certain physiological effect. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs. Drug Exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensings, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. Prescriptions filled at dispensing providers such as pharmacies, and then captured in reimbursement claim systems, Drugs administered as part of a Procedure, such as chemotherapy or vaccines.
